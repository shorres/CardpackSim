# Weekly Rotating Sets Feature

## Overview
The TCG Pack Simulator now includes a weekly rotating set system that automatically generates new, unique card sets every week based on the current date. This feature adds excitement and replayability by giving players limited-time content to collect.

## How It Works

### Weekly Set Generation
- **Time-Based**: Each week generates a unique set based on the current week number of the year
- **Seeded Random**: Uses deterministic generation so the same week always produces the same set
- **Themed Sets**: Each weekly set has a unique theme (e.g., "Elemental Fury", "Shadow Realm", "Divine Light")
- **Better Rates**: Weekly sets have improved mythic (1/6) and foil (1/4) chances compared to regular sets

### Set Composition
- **37 Total Cards**: 15 Common, 10 Uncommon, 8 Rare, 4 Mythic
- **Smaller Booster Boxes**: 24 packs instead of 30 for regular sets
- **Procedural Names**: Cards have generated names using themed word combinations
- **Three Card Types**: Creatures, Spells, and Artifacts with appropriate naming

### Card Name Generation
The system generates realistic card names by combining:
- **Rarity-based Adjectives**: More powerful adjectives for higher rarities
- **Card Types**: Creatures (Dragon, Knight, Wizard), Spells (Blast, Storm, Force), Artifacts (Sword, Crown, Orb)
- **Seeded Generation**: Same week always generates same cards for consistency

## Visual Features

### Special UI Elements
- **Gradient Styling**: Purple-to-pink gradient background for weekly packs
- **Golden Border**: Yellow border to highlight weekly packs
- **Weekly Badge**: "‚è∞ WEEKLY" indicator on pack displays
- **Countdown Timer**: Shows time remaining until new weekly set
- **Animated Glow**: Subtle pulsing glow effect on weekly packs

### Enhanced UX
- **Set Selector Styling**: Weekly sets appear with special colors in dropdown
- **Dynamic Button Text**: Booster box button shows correct pack count for each set
- **Featured Set Notification**: Banner highlighting the current weekly set
- **Auto-Refresh**: Page automatically refreshes when week changes

## Technical Implementation

1. **WeeklySetGenerator Class**: Handles all weekly set logic
2. **Seeded Random**: Ensures consistent generation for same week

### Integration Points
- **Data Layer**: `getAllSets()` function combines regular and weekly sets
- **Game Engine**: Modified to handle dynamic set lists
- **UI Manager**: Enhanced to display weekly set features
