# Project Structure Documentation

## Overview
Your single HTML file has been successfully modularized into a complete Electron project that can be built into an executable application.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Modular Architecture**
- **data.js**: Contains all TCG set definitions, card lists, and game parameters
- **storage.js**: Handles localStorage operations with error handling
- **game.js**: Core game logic including pack generation, collection management
- **ui.js**: All UI rendering, DOM manipulation, and event handling
- **app.js**: Application initialization and coordination

### 2. **Electron Integration**
- **main.js**: Complete Electron main process with window management, menus, security
- **preload.js**: Secure communication bridge between main and renderer processes
- Security features: context isolation, no node integration in renderer

### 3. **Build System**
- **electron-builder**: Professional build system for creating installers
- Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- NSIS installer for Windows with user-friendly installation options

### 4. **Developer Experience**
- **npm scripts**: Easy commands for development and building
- **build.bat**: One-click build script for Windows users
- Hot reload in development mode with DevTools

## Usage Instructions

### Development
```bash
npm install          # Install dependencies
npm start           # Run in development mode
npm run dev         # Run with DevTools open
```

### Building Executables
```bash
npm run build       # Build for current platform
npm run build-win   # Build Windows installer
npm run build-mac   # Build macOS DMG
npm run build-linux # Build Linux AppImage
```

### Windows Users
Double-click `build.bat` for easy one-click building.

## File Changes Summary

### What Was Extracted:

✅ Local storage persistence
✅ Responsive design with Tailwind CSS

## New Features Added
✅ Professional application window with menus
✅ Cross-platform executable building
✅ Secure Electron architecture
✅ Modular, maintainable codebase
✅ Easy development and build workflows

## Next Steps (Optional)
1. **Custom Icons**: Replace placeholder icons in `assets/` folder
2. **More Sets**: Add new TCG sets in `data.js`
3. **Enhanced Features**: Add new gameplay mechanics in respective modules
4. **Styling**: Customize appearance in `styles.css`
5. **Distribution**: Upload built executables to share with users

## Built Files
